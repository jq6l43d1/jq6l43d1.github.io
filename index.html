        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a tech enthusiast and my passion lies in exploring the endless possibilities that technology has to offer. I am a Linux devotee, and I am always eager to learn and experiment with new tools and techniques. My expertise lies in programming, and I am skilled in various programming languages such as Python, Go, Bash, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>When I am not working on tech-related projects, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies. I have been juggling for several years now, and I find it to be a great way to unwind and clear my mind. I am also an avid chess player, and I particularly enjoy playing the game's exciting variant, Crazyhouse. In my free time, I love to read books on a variety of topics, including psychology, chemistry and fiction. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the Japanese language and culture, and I am always studying new things to expand my knowledge.</p>
        <p>I created this website to share my experiences and knowledge with others who share my passion for technology and the things I enjoy. Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, share my thoughts and insights, and learn from others. Whether you are a fellow tech enthusiast, a juggling aficionado, or simply someone looking to learn something new, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopwatch-for-google-shee/dldgbenmbgcinedpcmkllgabdmihabon?hl=en">Google Sheets Stopwatch.</a></h3>
        <p>Recently, I successfully published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store. The extension adds a timer functionality to Google Sheets, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Although the coding process was straightforward, the approval process was not without its challenges. In fact, it took several attempts, a total of six resubmissions, before the extension was finally approved for publication.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, I did not have to make any changes to the code during the review process. Despite the challenges, I am proud to have successfully navigated the process and made my contribution to the Chrome Web Store.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/jq6l43d1/minimal-bitwarden-dedup-folders">Password Deduplicator</a></h3>
        <p>I recently made the switch from KeePassDX to Bitwarden as my password manager of choice. However, this transition was not without its challenges. Specifically, I had to consolidate three different databases into one, which was no easy feat.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I was able to find a program on GitHub that promised to remove duplicates from my databases. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that the program was not compatible with folders, which complicated the consolidation process. Not one to give up easily, I decided to take matters into my own hands and forked the repository. From there, I added the necessary functionality to ensure that the program worked with organized password folders.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am glad that I made the switch to Bitwarden, and I am proud to have been able to contribute to the password manager community by improving the functionality of an open-source program.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tasker/c/LJhmfxT2mj8?pli=1">Android screen touches and key press scripting</a></h3>
        <p>Years ago, I made a significant discovery in the world of Android automation: the ability to script screen touches and key presses. This breakthrough allowed me to create more sophisticated and streamlined processes on my device. I was thrilled to share this discovery with others, and it was not long before it caught the attention of the developers of the Android automation app Tasker.</p>
        <p>Thanks to my discovery, Tasker was able to integrate this functionality into its app, making it easier for users to automate their devices and streamline their mobile experience. It was a proud moment for me to see my contribution to the Android automation community recognized and integrated into such a popular and useful app.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the world of Android automation, and I hope that my work continues to benefit users of Tasker and other similar apps to this day.</p>
