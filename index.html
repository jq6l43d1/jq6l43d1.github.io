        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a tech worker. I love Linux. My favorite programming language is Python but Go has been growing on me lately. My hobbies include juggling, playing Chess (especially Crazyhouse), studying Japanese, and reading.</p>

        <h3>Google Sheets Stopwatch.</h3>
        <p>I published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store recently. It adds a timer to Google sheets. It was easier to write than it was to get published. I had to resubmit it for review 6 times before it got approved. I never changed any of the actual code throughout this process. I think they just got tired of me so they eventually relented and approved it.</p>
        <h3>Password Deduplicator</h3>
        <p>I recently switched password managers. I went from KeePassDX to Bitwarden. When I tried to make the switch I had 3 different databases I had to consolidate. I found a program on GitHub on github that got rid of the duplicates but it didn't work if the passwords are in organized into folders so I forked the repo and added this functionality.</p>
        <h3>Android screen touches and key press scripting</h3>
        <p>Many moons ago I discovered how to script screen touches and key presses on android. My discovery was integrated into the very popular Android automation app Tasker.</p>
