    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a tech enthusiast and my passion lies in exploring the endless possibilities that technology has to offer.
      I am a Linux devotee, and I am always eager to learn and experiment with new tools and techniques. My expertise
      lies in programming, and I am skilled in various programming languages such as Python, Go, Bash, and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not working on tech-related projects, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies. I have been juggling for
      several years now, and I find it to be a great way to unwind and clear my mind. I am also an avid chess player,
      and I particularly enjoy playing the game's exciting variant, Crazyhouse. In my free time, I love to read books
      on a variety of topics, including psychology, chemistry and fiction. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the
      Japanese language and culture, and I am always studying new things to expand my knowledge.</p>
    <p>I created this website to share my experiences and knowledge with others who share my passion for technology
      and the things I enjoy. Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, share my thoughts
      and insights, and learn from others. Whether you are a fellow tech enthusiast, a juggling aficionado, or simply
      someone looking to learn something new, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to
      connect.</p>
