        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a tech enthusiast and my passion lies in exploring the endless possibilities that technology has to offer. I am a Linux devotee, and I am always eager to learn and experiment with new tools and techniques. My expertise lies in programming, and I am skilled in various programming languages such as Python, Go, Bash, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>When I am not working on tech-related projects, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies. I have been juggling for several years now, and I find it to be a great way to unwind and clear my mind. I am also an avid chess player, and I particularly enjoy playing the game's exciting variant, Crazyhouse. In my free time, I love to read books on a variety of topics, from philosophy and science fiction to history and economics. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the Japanese language and culture, and I am always studying new things to expand my knowledge.</p>
        <p>I created this website to share my experiences and knowledge with others who share my passion for technology and the things I enjoy. Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, share my thoughts and insights, and learn from others. Whether you are a fellow tech enthusiast, a juggling aficionado, or simply someone looking to learn something new, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Google Sheets Stopwatch.</h3>
        <p>I published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store recently. It adds a timer to Google sheets. It was easier to write than it was to get published. I had to resubmit it for review 6 times before it got approved. I never changed any of the actual code throughout this process. I think they just got tired of me so they eventually relented and approved it.</p>
        <h3>Password Deduplicator</h3>
        <p>I recently switched password managers. I went from KeePassDX to Bitwarden. When I tried to make the switch I had 3 different databases I had to consolidate. I found a program on GitHub on github that got rid of the duplicates but it didn't work if the passwords are in organized into folders so I forked the repo and added this functionality.</p>
        <h3>Android screen touches and key press scripting</h3>
        <p>Many moons ago I discovered how to script screen touches and key presses on android. My discovery was integrated into the very popular Android automation app Tasker.</p>
