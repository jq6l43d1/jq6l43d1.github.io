        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a tech worker. I love Linux. My favorite programming language is Python but Go has been growing on me lately. My hobbies include juggling, playing Chess (especially Crazyhouse), studying Japanese, and reading.</p>

        <h3>Google Sheets Stopwatch.</h3>
        <p>I published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store recently. It adds a timer to Google sheets. It was easier to write than it was to get published. I had to resubmit it for review 6 times before it got approved. I never changed any of the actual code throughout this process. I think they just got tired of me so they eventually relented and approved it.</p>
