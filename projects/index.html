            Years ago, I made a significant discovery in the world of Android automation: the ability to script screen touches and key presses. This breakthrough allowed me to create more sophisticated and streamlined processes on my device. I was thrilled to share this discovery with others, and it was not long before it caught the attention of the developers of the Android automation app Tasker.
Thanks to my discovery, Tasker was able to integrate this functionality into its app, making it easier for users to automate their devices and streamline their mobile experience.

            I recently made the switch from KeePassDX to Bitwarden as my password manager of choice. However, this transition was not without its challenges. Specifically, I had to consolidate three different databases into one, which was no easy feat.
Thankfully, I was able to find a program on GitHub that promised to remove duplicates from my databases. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that the program was not compatible with folders, which complicated the consolidation process.

            I was recently assigned to develop a custom Linux distribution for WSL, and I opted to use Docker to create it. In the process of figuring out how to convert a Docker file into a functional WSL distro, I was struck by how few resources were available on this topic online. After I successfully navigated the steps required to make this conversion, I documented my findings here in the hopes that others may find them useful.

            Recently, I successfully published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store. The extension adds a timer functionality to Google Sheets, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Although the coding process was straightforward, the approval process was not without its challenges. In fact, it took several attempts, a total of six resubmissions, before the extension was finally approved for publication.
Interestingly, I did not have to make any changes to the code during the review process.
