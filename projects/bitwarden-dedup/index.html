        <p>I made the switch from KeePassDX to Bitwarden as my password manager of choice. However, this transition was not without its challenges. Specifically, I had to consolidate three different databases into one, which was no easy feat.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was able to find a program on GitHub that promised to remove duplicates from my databases. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that the program was not compatible with folders, which complicated the consolidation process. Not one to give up easily, I decided to take matters into my own hands and forked the repository. From there, I added the necessary functionality to ensure that the program worked with organized password folders.</p>
<p>Overall, I am glad that I made the switch to Bitwarden, and I am proud to have been able to contribute to the password manager community by improving the functionality of an open-source program.</p>
