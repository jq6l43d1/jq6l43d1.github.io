        <p>I successfully published <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stopwatch-for-google-shee/dldgbenmbgcinedpcmkllgabdmihabon?hl=en">my first extension</a> on the Chrome Web Store. The extension adds a timer functionality to Google Sheets, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Although the coding process was straightforward, the approval process was not without its challenges. In fact, it took several attempts, a total of six resubmissions, before the extension was finally approved for publication.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I did not have to make any changes to the code during the review process. Despite the challenges, I am proud to have successfully navigated the process and made my contribution to the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used Chat-GPT to write a poem about my experience.</p>
<p>After six rejections, I thought it was done,<br>
My extension, the stopwatch for Google Sheets,<br>
But then it happened, the seventh time around,<br>
It got published, and it brought me to my feet.</p>
<p>The excitement, the joy, the relief I felt,<br>
Were indescribable, they can&rsquo;t be put in words,<br>
For I had worked hard, and I never gave up,<br>
And now, my efforts had finally paid off, no holds barred.</p>
<p>I had spent hours coding, debugging, and testing,<br>
Trying to make my extension the best it could be,<br>
And now, with it published in the Chrome Web Store,<br>
I can finally share it with the world, and make it free.</p>
<p>For others, the stopwatch for Google Sheets,<br>
May seem like a small thing, a simple tool to use,<br>
But for me, it&rsquo;s a symbol of persistence and dedication,<br>
And the belief that with hard work, we can never lose.</p>
<p>So let this be a lesson to us all,<br>
To keep trying, and never give up on our dreams,<br>
For even when the road seems rough and tough,<br>
With determination, we can make it through, it seems.</p>
<p>And so, my stopwatch for Google Sheets,<br>
Is a reminder of the power of persistence and grit,<br>
For when we keep going, even when the odds are against us,<br>
We can achieve anything, and never quit.</p>
