                Sheets Stopwatch.</a></h3>
        <p>Recently, I successfully published my first extension on the Chrome Web Store. The extension adds a timer
            functionality to Google Sheets, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Although the coding process was
            straightforward, the approval process was not without its challenges. In fact, it took several attempts, a
            total of six resubmissions, before the extension was finally approved for publication.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, I did not have to make any changes to the code during the review process. Despite the
            challenges, I am proud to have successfully navigated the process and made my contribution to the Chrome Web
            Store.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/jq6l43d1/minimal-bitwarden-dedup-folders">Password Deduplicator</a></h3>
        <p>I recently made the switch from KeePassDX to Bitwarden as my password manager of choice. However, this
            transition was not without its challenges. Specifically, I had to consolidate three different databases into
            one, which was no easy feat.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I was able to find a program on GitHub that promised to remove duplicates from my databases.
            Unfortunately, I soon discovered that the program was not compatible with folders, which complicated the
            consolidation process. Not one to give up easily, I decided to take matters into my own hands and forked the
            repository. From there, I added the necessary functionality to ensure that the program worked with organized
            password folders.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am glad that I made the switch to Bitwarden, and I am proud to have been able to contribute to the
            password manager community by improving the functionality of an open-source program.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tasker/c/LJhmfxT2mj8?pli=1">Android screen touches and key press
                scripting</a></h3>
        <p>Years ago, I made a significant discovery in the world of Android automation: the ability to script screen
            touches and key presses. This breakthrough allowed me to create more sophisticated and streamlined processes
            on my device. I was thrilled to share this discovery with others, and it was not long before it caught the
            attention of the developers of the Android automation app Tasker.</p>
        <p>Thanks to my discovery, Tasker was able to integrate this functionality into its app, making it easier for
            users to automate their devices and streamline their mobile experience. It was a proud moment for me to see
            my contribution to the Android automation community recognized and integrated into such a popular and useful
            app.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the world of Android automation, and I hope
            that my work continues to benefit users of Tasker and other similar apps to this day.</p>
